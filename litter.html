    <h1 class="head">The Consequences of Littering</h3>

        <p>
            Littering is a big issue in our world, and in New Zealand. Lots of our litter ends up in the oceans, and
            some of that is eaten by marine life. Plastic is not good for marine life, as it logs up their insides, 
            and can even kill them. The leatherback sea turtle think that plastic bags are jellyfish, their food, so eat it.
            Some fish eat microplastics because they look like caviar, so eat the plastic.

            Did you know that the Great Pacific garbage patch has over 1 trillion pieces of rubbish in it, and weight 80,000 tons. 
            The area it covers is 5x larger than the land area of New Zealand. It just takes people to throw something out of the
            car window, or eat something and just leave the wrapper in the park. That is another unnecessary piece of rubbish where it
            does not belong. To find out more about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, watch this video:

            This image shows that littering is an issue in New Zealand. There is only more litter gathering around our country, and 
            there is no one solving the issue. By not litteing and helping, these numbers can come down.

        <p>
            There are a few very simple ways to help the probelm of littering.
        </p>

        <h4>1. Don't Litter</h4>

        <p> 
            The simplest way to solve this problem is but your rubbish in the bin. It is a really 
            simple and easy way to solve the problem
        </p>
        
        <h4>2. Pick up Other's Litter</h4>

        <p>
            Picking up other litter around your neighbourhood is another way to stop litter travelling
             into the ocean, and into nature. 
        </p>

        <h4>3. Tell Others about the Consequences of Littering!</h4>

        <p>
            Spreading the word around about littering can create an impact!
        </p>

        <h4 class="litters">On average, 300,000 sea creatures die a year because of plastic 
            littered into our oceans. Littering has huge consequences on our marine life, so please do not litter.</h4>
