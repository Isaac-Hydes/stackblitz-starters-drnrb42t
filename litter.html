    <h1>The Consequences of Littering</h3>

        <p>
            Littering is a big issue in our world, and in New Zealand. Lots of our litter ends up in the oceans, and
            some of that is eaten by marine life. Plastic is not good for marine life, as it logs up their insides, 
            and can even kill them. The leatherback sea turtle think that plastic bags are jellyfish, their food, so eat it.
            Some fish eat microplastics because they look like caviar, so eat them.
