    <h1>The Consequences of Littering</h3>

        <p>
            Littering is a big issue in our world, and in New Zealand. Lots of our litter ends up in the oceans, and
            some of that is eaten by marine life. Plastic is not good for marine life, as it logs up their insides, 
            and can even kill them. The leatherback sea turtle think that plastic bags are jellyfish, their food, so eat it.
            Some fish eat microplastics because they look like caviar, so eat the plastic.

            Did you know that the Great Pacific garbage patch has over 1 trillion pieces of rubbish in it, and weight 80,000 tons. 
            The area it covers is 5x larger than the land area of New Zealand. It just takes people to throw something out of the
            car window, or eat something and just leave it in the park, and that is another unnecessary piece of rubbish where it
            does not belong. To find out more about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, watch this video:
