    <h3>Welcome to the Elim Christian College Mount Albert Enviro Page!</h3> 
    <p> 
        On this page, learn about the bins around our school and the consequences of littering. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our school has different bins around. In most places, there are four bins. 
        There is soft plastics, recycling, food scraps and rubbish. 
        These bins all have unique and different items put in them. 
        It is important that we use these bins around the school because 
        it means that our rubbish is in the bins, and not around the school. 
        Littering can have huge consequences on the environment, especially 
        marine life in our oceans. By using the bins provided, you can 
        help New Zealand's marine life. All it takes is to put that piece of 
        rubbish into the bin, so why wait? 
        Start using the bins around our school today!
