    <h3>Welcome to the Elim Christian College Mount Albert Enviro Page!</h3> 
    <p> 
        On this page, learn about the bins around our school and the consequences of littering. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Our school has different bins around. In most places, there are four bins. 
        There is soft plastics, recycling, food scraps and rubbish.
        These bins all have unique and different items put in them.
