    <h1>The Bins around our School</h1>

    <p>Around our school, there are four bins. There is the food scraps bin, reycling bin, soft plastics bin, 
        and the rubbish bin. Each of these bins have different things that go in them, and this page will help 
        you identify what goes in each bin.</p>
    
    <h4>Food Scraps</h4>

    <p>The food scraps bin has organic food going into it, such as fruit and vegetables. Things that can not go 
        in the food scraps bin are processed foods, such as sandwiches.</p>

    <h4>Recycling</h4>

    <p>The recycling binis where materials that can be reused go, such as paper/cardboard, glass, tins/cans, and SOME 
        plastics. These are plastics 1, 2 and 5. These plastics are things such as plastic bottles and sushi containers.
        Plastcs 1, 2 and 5 are considered 'hard plastics'. Only put things in the reycling bin if they are clean. If 
        it is dirty, clean it or put it in the rubbish bin. Thinks that go in the recycling bin also need to be bigger than 5cm.</p>
    
    <h4>Soft Plastics</h4>

    <p>Soft Plastics are plastics that are 'soft'. These are things that would crinkle in your hand, like chip packets, 
       muesli bar wrappers, and cling film. </p>

    <h4>Rubbish</h4>

    <p>Everything else that does not fall into a category goes into the rubbish bin. This is things like juice boxes, milk lids,
       and dirty containers.</p>
